# User Instructions
# 
# Implement the function escape_html(s), which replaces
# all instances of:
# > with &gt;
# < with &lt;
# " with &quot;
# & with &amp;
# and returns the escaped string
# Note that your browser will probably automatically 
# render your escaped text as the corresponding symbols, 
# but the grading script will still correctly evaluate it.
